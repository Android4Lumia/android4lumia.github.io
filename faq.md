Flashing a modified LittleKernel Bootloader.

but nothing is promised.

### Can i do this on my main phone/is this stable?

**Don't** do this in your main phone, this isn't 100% stable and all things aren't working (like cellular networks, camera, some SD cards, etc).

**No**. Only original touchscreens are supported. It isn't easy to calibrate and support other touchscreens.

That means you don't have an original touchscreen. Go back to Windows Phone.

If you don't made a backup, you can't go back to Windows Phone. Every device backup is unique, so don't ask others for one.
