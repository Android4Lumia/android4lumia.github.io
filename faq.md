# **FAQ**
___________________________________________

### What is the Android4Lumia project about?

Android4Lumia is a project that lets users install Android-based custom ROMs on their Lumia phones.

### How is this even possible?

It is possible by flashing a modified LittleKernel Bootloader.

### Are all Lumia devices supported?

**No**. As of right now, only Lumia 520, 521, 525, 526, 720 and 720T devices are supported.
There are plans to support other Qualcomm Snapdragon S4-based Lumias as well, though we cannot certainly promise anything.

### Are third-party touchscreens supported?

**No**, only original touchscreens are supported.

### What things aren't working?

No signal SIM Card, camera and rotation.

### Can I install GApps (Google Apps)?

Yes, you can, but keep in mind that installing GApps will make your device run very slow.

### Are these ROMs stable enough to use on my daily driver phone?

**Do not** install this software on your daily devices, because it is not 100% stable at the moment. Perhaps, depending on the device, there is a lot of lag and there are some important things that do not work.

### I want to go back to Windows Phone but I have not made a backup.

If you have not made a backup, you cannot go back to Windows Phone because every device is unique.

### My phone got damaged!

We warned you before! **YOU** have chosen to make these modifications on your own, so do not point the finger at us for messing your phones up.
